'''Technical Layer'''
''Communication'': No standardized protocol yet, plenty of available projects to fork and integrate with TGP app layer. Needs to be dual layer (Hive / Internet)

''Hive'' (P2P wifi/bluetooth) Still in research. Options: <nowiki>https://github.com/moarpepes/awesome-mesh</nowiki>)

Optional dependency on Identity (can switch to anonymous mode for local mesh)

''Internet'' (hard dependency on Identity) easiest to link identity to Mastodon instances maintained by coops.


''Project Management:'' (Hard dependent on resource database, Identity; soft dependent on consensus)

Users initiate a project based on geographic location or internet domain. User sets scope of audience based on who it impacts and who it benefits.

''Proof of Identity:''

Your identity is yoursUser interactions, can Â Using a different table in the Resource database,


''Consensus Gathering:'' (Hard dependent on Identity and communication; soft on resource database)
